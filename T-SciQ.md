**# T-SciQ: Teaching Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Large Language Model Signals for Science Question Answering**
## Abstract
The T-SciQ approach generates high-quality CoT rationales as teaching signals and is advanced to train much smaller models to perform CoT reasoning in complex modalities

## Method
Step1：CoT 解决简单问题表现较好， 然而复杂问题不太行，采用 PCoT 将问题更加细分化
Step2：
